# Italian sources, in nominal "AWS Translate" JSON format

TODO: Split source files up to be under 5000 bytes (an AWS Translate limit)
      while respecting the flow of the text (e.g. don't break mid-sentence).

      Pre-process diacritics (AWS seems to choke on the double << >> chars).

      Look at how to use custom terminologies, and if they might make a
      difference for certain phrases that pop up a lot in the text.
