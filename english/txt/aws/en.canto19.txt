Or Simon wizard, or miserable followers
that the things of God, that of goodness
deon be brides, and you birds of prey

for gold, and for silver,
Now let the trumpet sound for you;
but in the third place you are.

Already we were, at the following tomb,
mounted from the rock in that part
that the ditch falls over the middle.

O supreme knowledge, how much art is
to show in heaven, on earth, and in the evil world,
and how righteous thy virtue cometh!

I saw by the coast and by the bottom
filled with the bruised stone of firs,
of one wide, and every one was round.

I do not think much wider or greater
who are in my beautiful Saint John;
made on site of the baptizers;

the one of them, which is not so many years,
I broke up for a drowning inside you:
And this may be a suggestion that every man dismantle.

Out of the mouth to each one soperchiated
of a sinner they feet and legs
up to the big, and the other inside stood.

The plants were at all lit intrambe;
that so loud the joints fluctuated;
that you break twisted and weirdos.

What soles the flame of greasy things
move up through the exhausting peel,
Such was there from the heels to the spikes.

“Who is he, master, who is crouted,
waving more than his other spouses,”
I said, “Whose flame is more burning?”

And he to me: “If thou wilt that bring thee thee
down there by the most lying steep,
of him thou shalt know of himself and of his wrongs.

And I was like, “As beautiful as you like it:
thou art a lord, and thou knowest that I shall not go
by thy will, and thou knowest what is silent.”

Then we came up the fourth embankment;
we turned and descended by hand tired
down there in the bottom forked and limb.

The good master still of his hip
did not dipudiate me, yes it came to me to the broken
of what one wept with his tank.

“Or whatever it is that the above holds down,
sad soul as a salesman”,
I begin to say, “if you can, it's a motto.”

I was like the friar who confesses
I wicked counselor, who, then that is thick,
recalls him so that death ceases.

And he cried out, “If thou hast already been right,
If you are already standing, Bonifatius?
Several years old he lied to me the writing.

If you're so tough with that satiated
for which you did not fear to 'nganno
the beautiful woman, and then to hurt her?”

So I made me, when they are color,
that they may not understand what is answered to them,
almost unscorned, and answer they do not know.

Then Virgil said, “Say it badly:
``I am not him, I am not he who believes "”;
And I remarried as it was imposed upon me.

For that spirit all twisted his feet;
then, sighing and with a voice of weep,
He said to me, “So what do you ask of me?

If you know that I am so cured...
But that you have the runn,
Know that I was clothed in the great mantle;

and truly I was the son of the bear.
cupid yea, to advance them bears.
and here I put myself in my purse.

There are other traits beneath my head
that precedetter me simoning,
for the slits de la stone plates.

I'll fall down there too when
He who believed that thou would,
Then I made it sound.

But more is the time already that my feet coughed me
and that I have been so underneath there,
that he shall not be planted with red feet:

for afterwards he will come more laden opra,
of ver' west, a shepherd without law,
so that he and me recover.

New Iasón will be, of which we read
in Maccabees; and as to that it was soft
his king, so be he who France holds.”

I don't know if I was too crazy here.
That I answered him at this metre:
“Now tell me, how much darling she wanted

Our Signor in first from St. Peter
that he put the keys in his hand?
Of course he did not ask if not ```Viemmi retro”.

Neither Pier nor others took away from Matia
gold or silver, when he was risen
to the place that lost his soul.

But it is for you, for you are well punished.
and look well at the badly taken coin
to be made against Charles daring.

And if it is not yet forbidding me
the reverence of the sums keys
that thou hast kept in the happy life,

I would use even more serious words;
for your avarice the world grieved,
Putting down the good ones and lifting the praves.

Of you shepherds saw the Vangelist,
when she who sits above the water
to shaggle with the kingdoms was seen to him;

the one who with the seven heads was born;
and from the ten horns he argued,
until her husband liked it.

You have made a god of gold and silver.
and what else is from you to idolatre,
but one, and ye bream an hundred?

Ow, Constantin, how ill he was mature,
not your conversion but that dowry
who took from you the first rich father'.

And while I was singing these notes,
the wrath or the knowledge that bitteth him,
strong pushed with both sides.

I believe that my duke liked it,
with so glad labbia always waited
the sound of the true words expressed.

But with both arms he took me;
and then all about it was in my chest,
he came back by the way, waves descended.

Nor did he get tired of having me in his own district,
Yes less he carried over the ridge of the arch
that from the fourth to the fifth embankment is a tragedy.

There he sweetly marries the carco,
gentle for the dirt and ert rock
that would be a hard break goats.

Then another Vallon was discovered to me.
