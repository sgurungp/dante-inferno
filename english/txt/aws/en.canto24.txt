In that part of the young year
that the sun the crins under the Aquarius quench
And the nights in the middle of the day are gone.

when the frost up the earth siege
the image of his white sister,
but little hard to his quenching feather,

the villain who misses the stuff,
stands up, and looks, and sees the countryside
to bleach all; waves he beat his hips,

comes back into the house, and here and there he mours,
like the tapin that does not know what to do;
then he returns, and hope rushes,

seeing the world having swirled face
in a short time, and takes his binding
and out of the sheep to hunt.

So I was shocked by the master.
And when I saw them, so that their forehead turned up,
and so badly came the mplar to the evil;

For as we came to the breakdown bridge,
he duke to me turned with that trick
sweet which I saw before at the foot of the mountain.

Arms open, after any advice
elected it with regard to before
well the ruin, and gave me the head.

And as those who use and esteem;
that always seems that 'neverly proved,
so, raising me up the top

of a buzzer, he warned another splinter
Saying, “Then hold on to it;
But try before it is so that she reigns thee.

He was not away as a hoodie dress,
for we in pain, and the slight and I pushed;
potavam up to the butt in the butt.

What if only from that precinct
more than from the other was the short coast,
I don't know about him, but I'd be well won.

But why Malebolge inverted the door
of the very low well all hangs,
the site of each valley leads

The one coast rises, and the other descends;
us though we came to the end up the tip
so that the last stone is unearthed.

The lena was me polmon yes milked
And when I was up, that he could not go beyond it,
But I sat in the first junta.

“Omai convien that thou thus spoil thee,”
said the master; “because, sitting in feather,
in fame they shall not come, nor shall they be covered;

without which he who his life consumes;
this vestige in the land of itself leaves,
as we were in the air and in the water the foam.

And yet rise up; win the ambascia
with the soul that conquers every battle,
if he doesn't fall with his grave body.

Longer scale convien that scales;
It is not enough for them to leave.
If you 'ntense me, now let me order you. '

Raise me then, showing me provided
better than Lena who doesn't hear me,
And I said, Go, that I am strong and bold.

Up the rock we took the way,
which was buzzing, narrow, and malaid,
and I did much more than before.

Speaking he went not to think faint;
And a voice came out of the other dite,
in words form disagreeable.

I don't know what he said, even though he was on his back.
ditches of the arch, as it crosses there;
but he who spoke to wrath seemed moved.

I was down, but my eyes are alive.
they could not rise to the bottom for the dark;
for that I: “Master, let thou come

from the other boar, and cut off the wall;
For as I hear and do not mean,
So I look down, and I don't put up.”

“Another answer,” he said, “I do not give you
but do not; for he sends her honest
We shall follow with the work by keeping silent.”

We descended the bridge from our head
where he joined with the eighth ripa,
And then there was the manifest bolgia:

and live there within terrible stipa
of snakes, and so different mena
that the memory of the blood still rips me.

No more brag Libya with its sand;
for if he hears, and jaculi, and make
produces, and cencri with amphisibena,

neither so many pestilenzie nor yes ree
showed already never with all Ethiopia
nor with what is above the Red Sea.

Between this raw and sad copy
Corrëan naked and frightened people,
without hope for elitropy:

with snakes the hands behind they had tied;
those were poking by the ren the tail
and the head, and they were grounded before.

And behold, to one which was of our product:
a snake pounced that pierced it
where the neck to the shoulders knots.

Neither O yes badly ever nor I was writed,
as El was kindled and burnt, and ash all
agreed that by falling it would become;

And then he was destroyed on the ground.
the polver picked up for itself
And 'n that medesm came back.

So for the great wise one confesses
that the phoenix more and then reborn
when in the fifteenth year hereafter;

grass nor biado in his life does not feed;
but only with incense tears and love;
And nardo and myrrh are the last bands.

And what is it that falls, and does not know comfort,
by the force of a demon that throws the ground,
or other oppilazion that binds the home,

when you rise, that 'nI come back you aim
all lost of the great anguish
which he suffers, and looked at, he sighs:

This was the sinner lifted up.
Oh power of God, how severe it is,
that I punched for revenge crosses!

Then the Duke asked who he was.
And he said, I was raining of Tuscany,
little time is, in this proud gorge.

Bestial life pleased me and not human,
as much as I was; I am Vanni Fucci
Beast, and Pistoia was a worthy den for me.”

And he said to the Duke: “Tell him that he does not hear,
and question that guilt down here the pinse;
that I saw him a man of blood and grief.”

It is the sinner, that 'ntese, not infinse,
but he raised his soul and his face to me,
and painted himself with sad shame;

And he said, “The more grievous I am that thou hast seized me
and the misery where you see me,
that when I was taken from the Hereafter life.

I cannot deny what you ask;
down I'm put so much because I was
thief to the sacristy of the beautiful furniture,

and falsely already was affixed to others.
But why do you not enjoy such sights,
if you ever be out of dark places,

open your ears to my announcement, and hate.
Pistoia in the Prior of the Neri wears down;
then Fiorenza renews people and ways.

Tragge Mars vapor from Val di Magra
which is cloudy clouds involute;
and with an impetuous and agra storm

over Campo Picen will be fought;
And the repentant will break the fogg,
so that every White will be wounded.

And I said it, so that I owe you.”
